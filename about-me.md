# About me

I enjoy thinking about how to provide the most helpful advice to young scientists. I am interested in sharing the wisdom and experience I have been so lucky and privileged to gain over [more than 20 years working in academic biomedical labs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7VDWHP4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Starting my career as a young scientist myself, I reveled in watching bugs and thinking about the chemistry of cooking, and I was very fortunate to [join a neuroscience lab](https://www.biomedicas.unam.mx/personal-academico/miguel-angel-morales-mendoza/) for a summer in high school. Now I draw from my adventures as in neurophysiologist to guide the scientists of the future [publish their first manuscripts](https://emerginginvestigators.org/), decide their academic future, or improve their application materials to take the next step in their academic career.

I studied to be a biomedical researcher at [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)](http://www.oferta.unam.mx/investigacion-biomedica.html) where I worked on finding plant compounds to inhibit *Helicobacter pylori* growth or [novel genes underlying MODY-type diabetes](https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.86.1.7134). Most importantly, I fell in love with electrophysiology and ion channel biophysics in the lab of Professor [Luis Vaca](http://www.ifc.unam.mx/investigadores/luis-vaca) while studying the effects of a very potent toxin, [Maitotoxin]( https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013036). I pursued graduate training at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ngg/) where I devoted 9 years to study the [mechanisms of ion channel function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=martinez-francois[au]+lu[au]) at the single molecule level in the lab of Professor [Zhe Lu](https://www.med.upenn.edu/physiol/facult/zhe-lu-md-phd). Excited by the possibilities of applying my molecular biophysics understanding to clinical problems, I became a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of Professor [Gary Yellen](https://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/gary-yellen) at Harvard Medical School. Thanks to good fortune and lots of hard work I have found the perfect environment to develop my science. I currently study how brain metabolism affects neuronal activity and how to use this knowledge to hopefully treat epilepsy.

I am immensely grateful to have so many great mentors and I am always delighted with the opportunity of passing some wisdom along.
